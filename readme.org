* Tales Of The Code
Tales of The Code is a text based game that was semi-inspired by the BBS Door Game
Legend Of the Red Dragon (LORD).

The Game will be more centered around the user typing in words rather than pressing letters.
Furthermore, I have been planning to add in some unique elements, for example:
	     - Teaching people programming
	     - Having a text editor
	     - Boss fights will be about solving bugs
And the list could go on and on.

** Installing
Tales Of The Code is not meant for installing at this point in time, but if you wish to do so:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  # Compile
  make
  # And to Run:
  ./TOTC
#+END_SRC
